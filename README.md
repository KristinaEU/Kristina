Kristina project source repository


Within the repository we need a folder structure resembling the various building blocks. I would suggest each partner to create a subfolder for their own additions. For those tools that are used by multiple partners, like SSI and SceneMaker we can create top-level folders. Maybe the guys from Augsburg can organize that?

Within the repository we will work with the Master branch as a continuous integrated code branch, therefor anything that is pushed to the Master should be compiling, working code. Feel free to create your own development branches when needed, merging to the Master at your own convenience. When we will do an integrated release (around demonstrations/reviews) we will create a release branch to trace such releases at later times.
